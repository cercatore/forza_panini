## Usage

deploy your server in anyway whatever you want

```bash
    py main.py
stdout:
# * Serving Flask app "main" (lazy loading)
# * Environment: production
#   WARNING: Do not use the development server in a production environment.
#   Use a production WSGI server instead.
# * Debug mode: on
# * Restarting with stat
# * Debugger is active!
# * Debugger PIN: 129-350-741
# * Running on 'http://0.0.0.0:5005/' (Press CTRL+C to quit)  

```
## Then

interrogate server
